Summing up, we have given an introduction to the MDS main conjecture and related topics in this thesis.
It is self-evident, that there are many things which were left untouched and many questions for which we could not give a satisfactory answer (e.g.~the completeness of normal rational curves in finite vector spaces; another gap which could not be closed is whether there is a classification of $(q+1)$-arcs when $n\leq 2p-2$).
Indeed, there are better results available in the case where $q=p^e$ for $e\geq 3$ stating that any $(q+1)$-arc is complete if $n\leq C\sqrt q$ for an appropriate constant $C$ (which depends e.g.~on the characteristic of $\field{q}$).
However, it would have taken us too far apart to present these in an appropriate manner to the undergraduate reader.
The initial intention --- to present the proofs of \person{Ball} and \person{de Beule} such that they can be understood by an undergraduate student --- should basically be achieved.
