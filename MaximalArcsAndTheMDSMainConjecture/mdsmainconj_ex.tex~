\begin{exercise}
    Prove that the \person{Hamming} distance is indeed a metric on $K^n$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
    As $d_H(a,b)=w_H(a-b)=w_H(b-a)$ it is clearly symmetric and identifying, i.e. $d_H(a,b)=0$ implies that $a_i=b_i$ for all $i\in n$ so $a=b$.
    The triangle inequality follows from the fact that $w_H(a+b)\leq w_H(a)+w_H(b)$ since for any $i\in n$ it follows from $a_i+b_i\neq 0$ that either $a_i\neq 0$ or $b_i\neq 0$.    
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
    Compute the size of a (closed) \person{Hamming} ball of radius $r\in\nats$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
    We count the elements of the closed ball of radius $r$ by counting seperately the elements of weight $w$.
    This yields
    $$
    \card{\ball_r}=\sum_{w=0}^r{\binom{n}{w}{(q-1)}^w}
    $$
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
    Let $\cC$ be an $(n,k,d)$-linear code which is MDS. Define the \emph{weight} of a vector $w(a)$ as $d_H(a,0)$. Analogously, for the elements of the corresponding projective space $\proj{\field{q}^n}$ define the weight of a point $a$ as the weight of some  representant of the linear subspace.
    Compute the size of the sets
    $$
    A_w:=\set{a\in\proj{\cC}:w(a)=w}.
    $$
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
    Recall the mapping $\pi:\field{q}^n\to\field{q}^{n-d+1}$ being injective on $\cC$ forgetting $d-1$ coordinates. The the preimage of any $w-d+1$-dimensional subspace of $\field{q}^{n-d+1}$ which is generated by a vectors attaining non-zero values only on a set $X\setleq n$ of size $w-d+1$ gives a $w-d+1$-dimensional subspace of $\cC$.
    
    Proceed in the following manner. Define for $X\setleq n$ that
    $$
    W(X):=\card{\proj\set{v\in \cC:v_i\neq 0\equival i\in X}}
    $$
    Then we have
    $$
    \sum_{Y\setleq X}{W(Y)}=
    \begin{cases}
        \frac{q^{\card{X}-d+1}-1}{q-1} &: \card X\geq d\\
        0 &: \otherwise    
    \end{cases}
    $$
    \person{MÃ¶bius} inversion gives us
    $$
    \sum_{\substack{Y\setleq X\\ \card{Y}\geq d}}{\mu(X,Y)\frac{q^{\card{Y}-d+1}-1}{q-1}}=W(X)
    $$
    where it is simple to show that $\mu(X,Y)={(-1)}^{\card X - \card Y}$ for $Y\setleq X$ and $\mu(X,Y)=0$ otherwise. This reveals
    $$
    \sum_{i=d}^{\card X}{{(-1)}^{\card{X}-i}\binom{\card X}{i}\frac{q^{i-d+1}-1}{q-1}}=\sum_{j=0}^{\card X-d}{q^j\sum_{i=d+j}^{\card X}{{(-1)}^{\card X -i}\binom{\card X}{i}}}=W(X)
    $$
    Using the fact that
    $$
    \sum_{i=0}^k{{(-1)}^i\binom{n}{i}}=(-1)^k\binom{n-1}{k}
    $$
    and letting $X$ run over all $w$-element subsets of $n$ we get the final result
    $$
    A_w=\binom{n}{w}\sum_{i=0}^{w-d}{{(-1)}^i\binom{w-1}{i}q^{w-d-i}}.
    $$
\end{solution}

\subsection{Connections}

We start by drawing some connections between some objects related to this last question.
It turns out, that there is a (up to projective equivalence) `one-to-one' correspondance between the following concepts.


We briefly demonstrate that fact.
A linear MDS code $\mathcal{C}$ is given by its check matrix $H(\mathcal{C})\in\field{q}^{(n-k)\settimes n}$ (that is a fully ranked matrix $H$ such that $\ker H=\mathcal{C}$). The property of $\mathcal{C}$ being MDS is equivalent to the property of $H(\mathcal{C})$ having no $d-1=n-k$ linearly dependend columns. Thus, any $(n-k)\settimes(n-k)$ submatrix of $H(\mathcal{C})$ must be regular. It is then clear, that if we choose the first $(n-k)$ vectors as a basis of $\col(H(\mathcal{C}))$ and rewrite the corresponding operator of $H$ in that basis, we obtain a matrix $H'=(I_{n-k}|M)$ where $M$ is totally regular. Of course we can also start form $M$ and construct a check matrix $H'$ of an MDS code in that manner. 
Interpreting the one-dimensional subspaces of the columns of the check matrix $H(\mathcal{C})$ as elements of the projective space $\proj(\col(H(\mathcal{C}))\iso PG(d-2,q)$ gives us an arc of size $n$ (we can also construct $H(\mathcal{C})$ from that arc).
Starting from a $k$-arc $\cA$ in $PG(n,q)$ we can get a central generic arrangement $\cB$ of hyperplanes by interpreting the elements of $\cA$ as (nonzero) linear functionals $\cF$ in ${(\field{q}^{n+1})}^{\ast}$ (which can be chosen up to scalar factor). Then $\cB:=\{\ker(f):f\in \mathcal{F}\}$ is the associated central generic arrangement.
Finally, we can get an (affine) generic arrangement from a central generic one by a deconing construction. If $P_{\mathcal{A}}(x_0,\ldots,x_n)=\prod{\cF}\in\field{q}[x_1,\ldots,x_{n+1}]$ is the defining polynomial of $\mathcal{A}$ (where $\{x_i:i=1,\ldots,n\}$ is a basis of $\field{q}^{n+1}$) then the affine generic arrangement $\mathcal{A}^{\aff}$ arising from that by deconing $\mathcal{A}$ has defining polynomial $P_{\mathcal{A}^{\aff}}(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=P_{\mathcal{A}}(1,x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ (that is the intersection of the hyperplanes in $\mathcal{A}$ with the one given by $x_0=1$).

\begin{conjecture}[main conjecture on MDS codes, $k$-arcs, generic arrangements in $\field{q}^n$]
  Let $m(n,q)$ be the minimum of all integers $m$ such that $\card{A}\leq m$ for any arc $\cA$ in $\PG(n,\field{q})$ then
  $$
    m(n,q)=\begin{cases}
      n+2 :& n \geq q\\
      q+2 :& n<q \lgand n\in\{2,q-1\} \lgand 2\divides q\\
      q+1 :& \textrm{otherwise}
    \end{cases}.
  $$ 
  Equivalently, $m(n,q)-1$ is the minimum of integers $m'$ such that for all generic hyperplane arrangements $\cB$ in $\field{q}^n$ it holds that $\card{\cB}\leq m'$ or $m(k-1,q)$ is minimal such that all linear MDS $(n,k)$-codes $\cC$ over $\field{q}$ satisfy $n\leq m(k-1,q)$.
\end{conjecture}
