\subsection{$(k,m)$-arcs in projective planes}

We start with some objects in the projective plane.

\begin{definition}[$(k,m)$-arc]
    Let $P$ be a projective space of order $q$. Then a set $\cA$ will be called a \keyword{$(k,m)$-arc} if $\card{\cA}=k$ and any line $l$ of
    $\pi$ intersects $\cA$ in at most $m$ pionts.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[$(m,n)$-secant]
    Let $\cS\setleq P$ be a subset of some projective space $P$. Then a subspace of (projective) dimension $n$ intersecting $\cS$ in exactly $m$ points is called an \keyword{$(m,n)$-secant} of $\cS$. In the case we are dropping the $n$ we mean a line. Moreover, a $2$-secant will also be denoted as \keyword{bisecant}, a $1$-secant as \keyword{tangent} and a $0$-secant as \keyword{external line}.
\end{definition} 

\begin{remark}
    Thus a $(k,m)$-arc in a plane $\pi$ is just a $k$-set having no $m'$-secants for $m'>m$.
\end{remark}

A very natural question (and also the main question in this entire thesis but stated for different objects) is clearly which values $k$ can attain for a given order $q$ of the plane and parameter $m$.

A simple bound for $k$ is given by the following general fact

\begin{lemma}[size of $(k,m)$-arcs]\label{kmarcs:lem1}
    Let $\emptyset\neq\cA\subset P$ be a $(k,m)$-arc and the space $P$ be of order $q$ and dimension $n$.
    Then it holds that
    \begin{equation}
        k=\card{\cA} \leq \binom[q]{n}{1}(m-1)+1
    \end{equation}
    where equality occurs if and only if any line in $P$ meets $\cS$ in either $0$ or $m$ points. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Pick a point $p\in\cA$. There are $\binom[q]{n}{1}$ lines through $p$ each of which carries at most $m-1$ other points of $\cS$.
    This gives the desired bound and conversely if this bound is attained a line passing through an arbitrary point $p\in \cS$ must clearly pass through $m-1$ other points of $\cA$.
\end{proof}

However, whether or not this bound is actually attained is no simple question already in the case where $n=2$ disregarding the cases where $m=q+1$ or $m=1$ (the above estimate requires $\cA$ to be not empty). 

\begin{definition}
    A $(k,m)$-arc in projective space $P$ is called \keyword{maximal} if it attains the bound of the \autoref{kmarcs:lem1}.
    It is called \keyword{complete} if it is maximal with respect to inclusion among all $(k,m)$-arcs in $P$.
\end{definition}

We might apologize for this somehow confusing definition by refering to the literature. Actually, to revisit this last last question
may observe that it sufficies to answer it in small dimensions (when $q$ is odd we will see that it sufficies to answer this question for $n=2$ for which \person{Thas} conjectured in \textbf{TODO:Ref} that there are no maximal $(k,m)$-arcs in odd planes, which was proven by \person{Ball}, \person{Blukhuis} et al.\ in \textbf{TODO:Ref}).

\begin{lemma}
    Let $\cA$ be a maximal $(k,m)$-arc in projective space $P$ and $P'\in\Sub(P)$ having non-empty intersection with $\cA$. Then the points of $\cA$ lying in $P'$ form another maximal $(k',m)$-arc.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Using \ref{kmarcs:lem1}, we have that for any point $p\in \cA\setmeet P'$ it holds that all lines through $p$ contain $m$ points whosing that $\cA\setmeet P'$ is maximal by that same fact.
\end{proof}

It is thus clear that the non-existence of maximal $(k,m)$-arcs in some dimension implies the non-existence in all higher dimensions (for Desarguian spaces).

We now turn to the case of a projective plane.

\begin{lemma}[dual $(k,m)$-arc]\label{kmarcs:lem2}
    Let $\cA$ be a $(k,m)$-arc in the plane $\pi$ such that $\cA\not\in\set{\emptyset,\pi}$ and $\cA'$ be the set of external lines of $\cA$. Then $\cA'$ is a $(k',\frac{q}{m})$-arc in the dual plane and maximal if and only if $\cA$ is maximal (especially, then $m\divides q$).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Let $E_p$ be a set of external lines of $\cA$ intersecting at $p\in\pi\setminus\cA$. Let $L_p$ be the lines incident with $p$.
    Then we have that $\card{L_p\setminus E_p}m\geq k$ with equality for any point $p\in\pi\setminus\cA$ if and only if $\cA$ is maximal (\ref{kmarcs:lem1}).
    Thus we get that
    $$\card{E_p}\leq \binom[q]{2}{1}-\frac{k}{m}\leq \frac{(q+1)m-((q+1)(m-1)+1)}{m}=\frac{q}{m}.$$
    Equality holds for all $p\in\pi\setminus\cA$ if and only if $\cA$ is maximal.
    Lastly, we may compute $k'$ by a double counting argument
    \begin{align*}
        k' & = \frac{1}{q+1}\sum_{p\in P\setminus\cA}{\card{E_p}}\leq \frac{q}{m}\frac{q^2+q+1-(qm+m-q)}{q+1} \\
           & = \frac{q(q+1)}{m}-q.
    \end{align*}
\end{proof}

We now introduce another concept which in coincides with the one of a $(k,m)$-arc in dimension two for $m=2$.

\begin{definition}[$k$-arc]
    A $k$-set $\cA\setleq \PG{n}{\field{q}}$ is called a \keyword{projective $k$-arc} if no $n+1$ points of $\cA$ lie in a common hyperplane.
    A set $\cA'\setleq \field{q}^{n+1}$ such that $\set{\gen{s}:s\in\cA'}$ is a projective $k$-arc and $\gen{s}\neq\gen{s'}$ for $s,s'\in\cA'$ is called an \keyword{affine representation} of the arc $\cA$.
    Analogously, a $k$-set $\cA\setleq \field{q}^n$ is called an \keyword{affine $k$-arc} if any $n+1$ points are affinely independent.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    We shall drop the parameter $k$ and the distinction between \emph{projective} and \emph{affine} arc in most cases when these things are clear from the context.
\end{remark}

As a corollary of \ref{kmarcs:lem2} it follows that there are no $(q+2)$-arcs for in planes of odd order. This is, as the reader will notice later, a first (however simple) result which hints to the MDS main conjecture.

However, in even planes, things are quiet different.
This is what we discuss next.

\subsection{Ovals and hyperovals}

\begin{definition}[oval]
    Let $\pi$ be a projective plane $\pi$ of order $q$. An oval $\cO$ in $\pi$ is a $(q+1)$-arc in $\pi$.  
\end{definition}

We already mentioned it, but to fix it as a fact, we have the following

\begin{lemma}[maximality of ovals if $q$ odd] 
    Let $\cO$ be an oval in a projective plane $\pi$ of odd order $q$.
    Then $\cO$ is a maximal arc.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} Apply \ref{kmarcs:lem2} for $m=2$ and $q$ odd.
\end{proof}

The more interesting object we wanted to discuss briefly is

\begin{definition}[hyperoval]
    Let $\pi$ be an even plane. A $(q+2)$-arc $\cO$ is called \keyword{hyperoval}.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    Clearly, an oval is a maximal $(q+2,2)$-arc.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}
    Let $\pi$ be an even plane, and $\cO$ be an oval. Then $\cO$ uniquely extends to a hyperoval by a point $n\in\pi$ called the \keyword{nucleus} of $\cO$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    We have to show that all $q+1$ tangents of $\cO$ meet in a unique point. Let $p\in\pi\setminus\cO$, and let $t_p$ be the number of tangents on $\cO$ and $s_p$ the number of secants on $\cO$ passing through $p$. Thus as $\card{\cO}=q+1$ we have by double counting argument
    $$
    q+1 \cong 2s_p+t_p \mod 2.
    $$
    showing that the number of tangents passing through $p$ is odd (so non-zero). Thus the $q+1$ tangents cover $q^2+q+1$ pints which shows that they must intersect in a unique point $n$ which follows form the more general fact that $k$ lines in the projective plane cover at most $kq+1$ where equality occurs if and only if they are concurrent. This fact can be demonstrated by the three double counting identities in which $t_i$ denotes the number of points of the union of lines lying in exactly $i$ of them
    $$
    \sum_{i=1}^k{t_i}=N
    $$
    and
    $$
    \sum_{i=1}^k{it_i}=k(q+1)
    $$
    and
    $$
    \sum_{i=1}^k{i(i-1)t_i}=k(k-1)
    $$
    where subtracting the first from the second and multiplying the result by $k$ results in
    $$
    \sum_{i=1}^k{k(i-1)t_i}=k(k(q+1)-N)\geq \sum_{i=1}^k{i(i-1)t_i}=k(k-1)
    $$
    where equality occurs if and only if $t_i=0$ for $i=2,\ldots,k-1$ and $t_k=1$. In that case $N=kq+1$.    
\end{proof}

For the sake of completeness, we proof another fact about hyperovals in Desarguian planes.

\begin{lemma}
    Let $\cO$ be a hyperoval in a Desarguian plane $\pi$. Then $\cO$ is $\PGL$-equivalent to some oval admitting an affine representation
    $$
    \cC:=\set{e_1,e_2}\setjoin\set{\begin{pmatrix} 1\\ z\\ f(z)\end{pmatrix}:z\in\field{q}},
    $$
    where $f(z)$ is an \keyword{$\cO$-polynomial}, i.e. $x\mapsto f(x)$ and $h\mapsto\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$ permute $\field{q}$.
    Moreover, one may assume that $f(0)=0$ and $f(1)=1$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    It is well-known that $\PGL(n,\field{q})$ acts sharply transitive on the $(n+1)$-sets in general position of $\proj(\field{q}^n)$. Thus we may assume that the four vectors $e_1,e_2,e_3$ and $e_1+e_2+e_3$ are part of our representation (using an appropriate element if $\PGL$).
    Using an appropriate scalar we thus may assume that the first coordinates of these vectors are one. Since otherwise two of these vectors would be colinear with $\gen{e_3}$ the second coordinates of them must all be distinct.
    Evaluating the determinants we get
    $$
    \det\begin{pmatrix} 0& 1& 1\\ 1& a& b\\ 0& f(a)& f(b)\end{pmatrix} = f(a)-f(b)\neq 0
    $$
    and so $f$ is a permutation polynomial and that
    $$
    \det\begin{pmatrix} 1& 1& 1\\ a& b& c\\ f(a)& f(b)& f(c)\end{pmatrix} = (a-c)f(b)+(b-a)f(c)+(c-b)f(a)\neq 0 
    $$
    which leads to
    $$
    (f(a)-f(b))(a-c) \neq (f(a)-f(c))(a-b)
    $$
    or equivalently $h\mapsto \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$ is injective for all $x\in\field{q}$.
\end{proof}

Using this fact the following hyperovals are natural to discover and \person{Segre} was the first who did.

\begin{corollary}[translation hyperovals]
    Let $q=2^e$. Then the set
    $$
    \cC:=\set{e_1,e_2}\setjoin\set{\begin{pmatrix} 1\\ z\\ f(z)\end{pmatrix}:z\in\field{q}},
    $$
    where $f(z)=z^{2^i}$ is a hyperoval if and only if $i\meet e=1$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
    Clearly, as $f$ is a field automorphism, it is a permutation polynomial. Moreover, the map $h\mapsto \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}=h^{2^i-1}$ is injective if and only if $(2^i-1)\meet(2^e-1)=2^{i\meet e}-1=1$ which holds if and only if $i\meet e=1$ (here we use that $\units{\field{q}}$ is cyclic).
\end{proof}

Other hyperovals, which can be discovered in a similar manner are

\begin{corollary}
    The polynomial $f(z)=z^6$ is an $\cO$-polynomial in $\field{q}$ where $q=2^e$ and $e$ is odd.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
    The equation $x^3-y^3$ factors into $(x-y)(x^2+xy+y^2)$. But the equation $x^2+x+1$ is irreducible for $e$ odd since otherwise the field extension $\field{q}/\field{2}$ would have even degree. Now $h\mapsto \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}={(x^2+xh+h^2)}^3h^2$
\end{proof}
