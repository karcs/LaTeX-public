\section*{Acknowledgement}

I want to thank Sebastian Manecke for some linguistic corrections.
Furthermore, I wish to thank my supervisor Prof.~Dr.~Ulrich Brehm for useful advice, which hopefully increased the comprehensibility of my work, and Prof.~Dr.~Gerhard RÃ¶hrle as well as Dr.~Torsten Hoge who gave me an idea about a connection of the MDS main conjecture and \person{Zaslavsky}'s lemma.
Lastly, I would like express my gratitude to Susanne Stimpert for a useful conversation helping me to clean my mind and to complete this thesis.
