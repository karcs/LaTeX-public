\begin{abstract}
The theorem of Perron-Frobenius in a finite dimensional space is usually proven using means like Brouwers fixed point theorem or metrics in which the corresponding mapping is somehow contractive (Banachs fixed point theorem).
We will give a geometric proof on the subject to emphasize that it is not necessary to apply means which work for general compact (continuous) mappings. 
Moreover, we will introduce a generalized form of irreducible matrices for which several interesting spectral properties shall be proven.
In the last section, some graph-theoretical application of the theorem is presented.
\end{abstract}

\section{Symbols}

We will use the following symbols through this paper

\begin{itemize}
\item $V$ denotes some ordered vector space over $\reals$ with generating cone $V^+$ admitting base $B$. 
If said, it is finite-dimensional (dimension is usually denoted by $n$) or its cone has polytopic base.
\item $P$ denotes some compact polytope in $V$.
\item $T$ denotes some strictly positive linear operator from $V$ to $V$.
\item $\norm{\cdot}$ denotes the Euclidean norm in finite dimensional space.
\item $\varrho(A)$ the spectral radius of operator $A$.
\item $\sigma(A)$ the spectrum of operator $A$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Some definitions around polytopes}

As the theorem of Perron-Frobenius is especially interesting when stated for polytopic cones, we will need the following

\begin{definition}[finite-dimensional compact polytope]\label{def1}
Let $V$ be a linear space and $P\subset V$. Then $P$ is called a \emph{compact finite-dimensional polytope} if $P=\conv S$ for some finite set $S\subset V$.
\end{definition}

Later we will speak about $k$-dimensional faces and the $k$-dimensional boundary of a polytope. So we will give some definitions of these things.

\begin{definition}[degree, boundary, face]\label{def2}
Let $P$ be a finite-dimensional compact polytope and let $p\in P$. We define the \emph{degree} of $p$ (with respect to $P$) as the maximum of the dimension of the faces in whose interior\footnote{all topological expressions are meant in the Euclidean topology} $p$ lies. Formally,

\begin{equation}
\deg_P p := \max\{|Q|:Q\subset P, Q \text{ affinely independent } \wedge p\in\int \conv Q\}-1
\end{equation} 

Then we define the \emph{$k$-dimensional boundary} $\partial_k{P}$ by

\begin{equation}
\partial_k{P}:= \deg_P^{-1}\{l\in\nats_0:l\leq k\}\text{.}
\end{equation}

Furthermore, any maximal convex subset of $\partial_k{P}$ is called a \emph{$k$-dimensional face}.
\end{definition}  

\begin{remark}\label{rem1}
The set $\partial_0 P$ will also be denoted as \emph{vertices}. It is an easy exercise to show that for any $n$-dimensional (line-)compact convex polytope $P$ ($n\in\nats$) the sets $\partial_0 P,\ldots, \partial_n P$ are not empty, but in general a convex polytope or simplex does not need to have finite-dimensional faces. The reader is invited to think of such polytopes (hint: consider the base of the Archimedean vector lattice $C[0,1]$ with the pointwise order).
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}\label{rem2}
One may take $Q\subset\partial_0 P$ in the above definition (as we are in the finite-dimensional case).
\end{remark}

We will see that the spectral properties of special linear maps become especially nice when we have a lattice cone. Thus we will need a further 

\begin{definition}[simplex]\label{def3}
Let $V$ be a linear space and $S\subset V$ a convex set such that for any two homotheties $\alpha, \beta:V\to V$ the intersection $\alpha(S)\intersect\beta(S)$ is either empty or the image $\gamma(S)$ of $S$ under another homothety $\gamma:V\to V$. Then we call $S$ a \emph{simplex}.
\end{definition}

Of course this definition might differ slightly from the readers intuition of an $n$-simplex in the Euclidean space $\reals^n$, ignoring compactness. So we will need a further

\begin{definition}[line-compactness]\label{def4}
Let $V$ be a linear space and $C\subset V$. Then $V$ is called \emph{line-compact} if for some line $l\subset V$ (one-dimensional subspace) the set $C\intersect l$ is compact (in the topology of the line - i.e. the default topology of $\reals$).
\end{definition}

It should be clear that we may replace $l$ in this definition by a finite dimensional subspace (using the Euclidean topology of this space). Now it is a routine matter to check that a line-compact simplex in the sense of these two definition coincides with the notion of an $n$-simplex (that is a convex hull of $n+1$ points).

\begin{remark}\label{rem3}
The reader might ask why we use such general definition instead of just the version for finite dimensional spaces. The reason for this is that from this definition one should directly see that the intersection of a chain of simplices is itself a simplex. This property will be of importance.
\end{remark}

The following simple facts about simplices and finite-dimensional polytopes shall be mentioned at this point (without proof):

\begin{itemize}
\item Let $(S_\alpha)_{\alpha\in\mathcal{A}}$ be a chain of simplices (that is $S_\alpha\supset S_\beta$ for $\alpha\leq\beta$). Then $\intersection_{\alpha\in\mathcal{A}}{S_\alpha}$ is itself a simplex\footnote{This is what was mentioned in remark (\ref{rem3})}. The same holds for compact finite-dimensional polytopes.
\item A face of a simplex is itself a simplex (the same for polytopes).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Irreducible and primitive operators}

Moreover, we give a definition on primitive operators and generalize the notion of a positive irreducible matrices or operator for our purposes

\begin{definition}[primitive operator]\label{def5}
Let $A:V\to V$ be a linear operator on a finite dimensional space. Then $A$ is called \emph{primitive} if there is some $m\in\nats$ such that $A^m[V^+\setminus\{0\}]\subset\int V^+$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def6}
Let $V$ be an ordered vector space of finite dimension $n$ with $V^+$ admitting polytopic base $B$ and $A:V\to V$ be a linear operator.
$A$ is called \emph{Perron-Frobenius}\footnote{this definition is newly introduced} if $A[F]\not\subset F$ for any $k$-dimensional face $F$ of $V^+$ ($k\leq n-1$).
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label{rem4}
Normally, definition (\ref{def3}) are given for $V=\reals^n$ and the standard cone $\reals^n_+$.
An \emph{irreducible matrix} is a matrix $A$ for which there is no permutation matrix $P$ such that $P^{-1}AP=\diag(A_1,A_2)+B$ where $A_1,A_2$ are non-empty square matrices. The notion of these definitions arise from graph theory (a positive irreducible matrix is the weighted adjacency matrix of a \emph{strongly connected} directed graph and a primitive matrix is the adjacency matrix of a strongly connected graph $G$ having the property that $\gcd\{|C|:C \text{ is circle in } G\}=1$.
\end{remark}

\section{The theorem}

The theorem of Perron-Frobenius can be stated for both types of matrices (where we introduced the definition (\ref{def4}) because it is the most general definition which preserves the most facts of the theorem as originally stated for positive matrices).

\begin{theorem}[Perron-Frobenius theorem for primitive operators]\label{theo1}
Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional Archimedean vector space\footnote{it is well known that any finite-dimensional Archimedean space admits a base as a strictly positive linear functional always exists} with generating cone and $T$ be some primitive operator. Then the following facts hold
\begin{enumerate}
\item There is a unique (up to positive multiples) positive eigenvector $v\in V^+$ which lies in the interior of $V^+$.
\item The corresponding eigenvalue $\lambda$ is simple\footnote{algebraic multiplicity one} of $v$ is the strict maximum in modulus among all complex eigenvalues of $T$, thus $\lambda=\varrho(T)$ ($\varrho(T)$ is the spectral radius of $T$).
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Perron-Frobenius theorem for operators being Perron-Frobenius]\label{theo2}
Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional ordered vector space with $V^+$ admitting polytopic generating base $B$ with $q$ vertices and $T$ be some irreducible operator. Then the following facts hold
\begin{enumerate}
\item There is a unique (up to positive multiples) positive eigenvector $v\in V^+$ which lies in the interior of $V^+$.
\item The corresponding eigenvalue $\lambda$ of $v$ is simple and the greatest eigenvalue in modulus among all complex eigenvalues of $T$, that is $\lambda=\varrho(T)$ ($\varrho(T)$ is the spectral radius of $T$).
\item For any other complex eigenvalue $\lambda'$ of maximal modulus we have $\lambda'=\varrho(T)\zeta$ where $\zeta$ is some primitive root of unity whose order is $\leq q$. In the case $B$ is a simplex than $\sigma(T)\intersect\{c\in\complex:|c|=\lambda\}=\langle \zeta_{q'}\rangle \lambda$ for some $q'$ with $q'\leq q$.\footnote{here $\langle \zeta_{q'}\rangle$ means the group generated by $\zeta_{q'}=\e^{2\pi\i/q'}$} Moreover, for all these $\lambda'$ the algebraic and geometric multiplicity coincide.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}
Consider the operator (which is Perron-Frobenius)
\begin{equation}
A=\small\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \cos(2\pi/q) & -\sin(2\pi/q) \\ 0 & \sin(2\pi/q) & \cos(2\pi/q)
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation} 
acting on $\reals^3$ with a cone 
\begin{equation} 
K:=\conv\left\{
\small\begin{pmatrix}
1\\
\cos(2\pi i/q)\\
\sin(2\pi i/q)
\end{pmatrix}
:i=0,\ldots,q-1\right\}\text{.}
\end{equation}
We see that its eigenvalues are $1,\e^{\pm 2\pi\i/q}$. The positive eigenvector $\tiny\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
0 \\
0 
\end{pmatrix}$ is an internal point of $V^+$.
\end{example}

\section{Collecting some ideas}

\subsection{Proof of existence.}

The main goal of this section is to establish Perron-Frobenius using some kind of geometric argument.
The following lemma would directly follow from Brouwers fixed point theorem.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem1}
Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional vector space ($n\in\nats$)\footnote{by $\nats$ we denote the set $\{1,2,3,\ldots\}$} with a cone $V^+$ admitting polytopic base $B$ (i.e. $B$ is a compact polytope). Let $T$ be a strictly positive operator. Define the equivalence relation $\sim:=\{(u,v)\in V\setminus\{0\}:\exists \lambda>0:u=\lambda v\}$.  Then the map $T\restrict_{V\setminus\{0\}}/\sim=:\chi$ has a fixed point in $V^+\setminus\{0\}/\sim$ (i.e. $T$ has an eigenvector in $V^+$).  
\end{lemma}

\begin{remark}\label{rem5}
The space $V\setminus\{0\}/\sim$ is isomorphic to $S^{n-1}$. For $n$ even any continuous map from $S^{n-1}$ to $S^{n-1}$ admits a fixed point (corollary of Lefschetz fixed point theorem). 
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}\label{rem6}
In our further considerations we set $B$ to be generating (otherwise consider the lowerdimensional problem in $\lin B$). In this case we already know that $B=V^+\intersect f^{-1}\{1\}$ for some strictly positive functional %$f$.
\end{remark}

During the proof of this lemma we also want to establish some kind of characterization.
The (short) proof of the lemma will be a minor part of that and will be given later. At first we impose some more general considerations.

\subsection{The map $\rho$}

\begin{definition}
Introduce the map $\rho:B\to B$ by

\begin{equation}
\rho=\phi^{-1}\frac{T\restrict_{V^+\setminus\{0\}}}{\sim}\phi
\end{equation}

where $\phi$ is the \emph{natural projection map} $\phi:B\to V^+/\sim$ with $\phi(b):=[b]_\sim$ for $b\in B$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
By definition of $\rho$, $T$ admits a positive eigenvector if and only if $\rho$ has a fixed point.
\end{remark}

Now we are ready for the following important

\begin{lemma}\label{lem2}
The map $\rho$ has the following three properties
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\rho$ is continuous.
\item For any set $A\subset B$ we have $\conv\rho[A]=\rho\conv A$.\footnote{The analogue identity $\aff\rho[A]=\rho\aff{A}$ does not hold in general.}
\item If $P\subset B$ is a compact convex polytope such that $\dim\aff{P} = \dim\aff\rho[P]$ then $\rho$ preserves $\deg$, i.e. $\deg_P{p} = \deg_{\rho[P]}\rho(p) = k\leq n-1$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clearly, as $V$ is a finite-dimensional Euclidean space, we have $T$ being continuous. Now taking the quotient topology and conjugating with the natural projection map $\phi$ does not destroy anything. 
\item Let us pick a set $A\subset f^{-1}\{1\}$. By definition any point $a\in\conv{A}$ or $a\in\aff{A}$ admits a representation $a=\sum_{i=1}^l{\alpha_i a_i}$ with $a_i\in A, \alpha_i>0$ forall $i=1,\ldots,l$ and $\sum_{i=1}^l{\alpha_i}=1$. We then have by 
\begin{equation}
\rho(a)=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^l{\alpha_i T(a_i)}}{f\left(\sum_{i=1}^l{\alpha_i T(a_i)}\right)}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^l{\alpha_i\lambda_i\rho(a_i)}}{f\left(\sum_{i=1}^l{\alpha_i T(a_i)}\right)}\label{eq1}
\end{equation}
that $\rho(a)\in\conv\rho[A]$ as we may obtain a convex combination of $\rho(a)$ in $\rho(a_i)$ ($i=1,\ldots,l$) by considering the fact that there exist (unique) $\lambda_i>0$ such that $\lambda_i\rho(a_i)=T(a_i)$ ($i=1,\ldots,l$). Thus $\conv\rho[A]\supset\rho\conv A$.

For the other inclusion consider $\tilde{a}=\sum_{i=1}^l{\alpha_i \rho(a_i)}\in\conv\rho[A]$ for $a_i\in A, \alpha_i>0$ forall $i=1,\ldots,l$ and $\sum_{i=1}^l{\alpha_i}=1$. By taking the $\lambda_i$ ($i=1,\ldots,n$) as in the previous case, we obtain that
\begin{equation}
\tilde{a}=\sum_{i=1}^l{\frac{\alpha_i}{\lambda_i} T(a_i)}=T\left(\sum_{i=1}^l{\frac{\alpha_i}{\lambda_i} a_i}\right)=\rho\left(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^l{\frac{\alpha_i}{\lambda_i} a_i}}{f\left(\sum_{i=1}^l{\frac{\alpha_i}{\lambda_i} a_i}\right)}\right)\text{.}\label{eq2}
\end{equation}
Thus we obtain the desired equality $\conv\rho[A]=\rho\conv A$.
\item We will show now: a subset $C\subset P$ is linearly (affinely) independent if and only if $\rho[C]$ is linearly independent (linearly and affinely independence are equivalent for such $C$ as $0\not\in P$).

\textbf{$\impliedby$:} So let us suppose $C$ is linearly dependent, i.e. for some numbering of the elements of $C$ by $c_1,\ldots,c_p,\overline{c}_1,\ldots,\overline{c}_q$ we have $\delta_1,\ldots,\delta_p,\gamma_1,\ldots,\gamma_q\geq 0$ with $\sum_{i=1}^p{\delta_i}=\sum_{i=1}^q{\gamma_i}=1$ (this condition comes from $f(0)=0$ for the corresponding strictly positive functional) such that 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^p{\delta_i c_i}=\sum_{i=1}^q{\gamma_i \overline{c}_i}\text{.}\label{eq3}
\end{equation}

Plugging the $c_i$ and $\overline{c}_i$ in the role of the $a_i$ in equation (\ref{eq1}) one obtains that $\rho[C]$ is affinely dependent.

\textbf{$\implies$:} For the other direction we will need the dimension condition. 

Suppose there is a set $C$ of linearly independent points such that $\rho[C]$ is linearly dependent. Clearly, $|C|\leq k+1$ as $C\subset P$ and $\dim\aff P=k$, but we may extend $C$ to a $(k+1)$-element set $\tilde{C}$ such that $\rho[\tilde{C}]$ is stil linearly dependent. If we now pick some point $p\in P$ we get a unique representation of it as $p = \sum_{i=1}^{k+1}{\epsilon_i \tilde{c}_i}$ (with $\sum_{i=1}^{k+1}{\epsilon_i}=1$). Now, shifting the negative $\epsilon_i$ to the side of $p$ and applying equation (\ref{eq1}) we get that $\rho(p)\in\aff\rho[\tilde{C}]$ a contradiction to the condition $\dim\aff\rho[P]=k$.

As we now have shown that affinely independence and lying in the interior of a convex set are preserved (to see this consider equations (\ref{eq1}) and (\ref{eq2})), we may deduce the desired result.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
In the case where $T$ does not act regular on the set $P$, $\deg$ may increase and decrease. This can be seen from a tetrahedran which degrades to a triangle (i.e. the degree of one vertex increases) and a tetrahedran which degrades to a line (where two antipodal edges degrade to point - here the degree of the internal points of theses edges decreases).
\end{remark}

\subsection{The $\rho$-invariant polytope (or simplex) $\tilde{B}$}

The first thing we do is to simplify the problem a bit by the following consideration. Define 

\begin{equation} 
\tilde{B}:=\intersection_{m\in\nats}{\rho^m[B]}\text{.}
\end{equation} 

Then $\tilde{B}$ as an intersection of a chain of compact sets cannot be empty by Dedekinds principle.
Note that if $\rho$ has a fixed point in $B$ then it has to be in $\tilde{B}$. Furthermore, for $n\in\nats$ the set $\rho^m[B]$ must also be a convex compact polytope (or a simplex if $B$ is a simplex). This can be seen by observing that $\rho[B]=\conv\rho[\partial_0 B]$ where $\partial_0 B$ are the vertices of $B$ (cf. lemma (\ref{lem2}) second fact). 

Using a similar argument we obtain that $\tilde{P}$ also has to be a compact convex polytope (or a simplex if $B$ is a simplex, respectively). This argument is based on the fact that the property of a point $v\in M$ lying in $\conv A$ for some finite set $A$ is continuous, i.e. taking a limit point of the sequence $(\rho^m(v),\rho^m[\conv{A}])_{m\in\nats}$ we have the same property. Thus it is true that $\tilde{B}=\conv L$ where $L$ is some limit point of the set valued sequence $(\rho^m[\partial_0 B])_{m\in\nats}$ (which exists since a the product space of compact spaces is compact by Tychonoffs theorem).
 

\paragraph{The degraded case.} If $\tilde{B}$ has lower dimension than $B$ we may consider the 'projected' problem in the ordered subspace $\lin\tilde{B}\subset\intersection_{i\in\nats}\img{T^i}$ equipped with the order induced by the cone $V^+\intersect\lin\tilde{B}$ on which $T$ acts as a bijection. 
Maybe, we shall mention at this point that the 'initial' case where $V$ is one-dimensional (if $\dim V=0$ we had no strictly positive operator and no base $B$) is trivial. 

\subsection{The case $T$ being regular.}
Thus let us assume that $\dim\lin\tilde{B}=n\geq 1$ (actually this implies $T$ being regular). 
Then it is immediately clear that $\rho[\partial_0{\tilde{B}}]=\partial_0{\tilde{B}}$ by considering the fact that $\tilde{B}$ is fixed under $\rho$ and $\rho$ preserves $\deg$ as $T$ is regular (cf. lemma (\ref{lem2}) part 3). 
Thus $\rho$ acts on the set of vertices of $\tilde{B}$ as a finite permutation which has some representation of the form $\rho\restrict_{\partial_0{\tilde{B}}}=c_1\compose\cdots\compose c_l$ (where $c_i$ for $i=1,\ldots,l$ are disjoint cycles). 
Let us denote the vertices of $\tilde{B}$ by $v_1,\ldots,v_m$ and define $\tau$ implicitly by $\rho\restrict_{\partial_0{\tilde{B}}}(v_i)=v_{\tau(i)}$ for $i=1,\ldots,m$. 

From the following we will see that the number of fixed points of $\rho$ is at least $l\geq 1$ and thus establish lemma (\ref{lem1}).

\paragraph{The case $\tau$ being itself a cycle.}

Let us now consider the case that $\rho\restrict_{\partial_0{\tilde{B}}}$ is itself a cycle (which is not trivial). 
We then have some positive $\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_m$ such that $T(v_i)=\lambda_iv_{\tau(i)}$ for ($i=1,\ldots,m$). 
It is now an easy matter to solve the arising equation (for an eigenvector of $T$ in $\tilde{B}$)

\begin{equation}
T\left(\sum_{i=1}^m\mu_iv_i\right)=\sum_{i=1}^m\mu_i\lambda_iv_{\tau(i)}=\lambda \sum_{i=1}^m\mu_iv_i
\end{equation}

from which one obtains $\frac{\mu_i}{\mu_{\tau(i)}}=\frac{\lambda}{\lambda_i}$ ($i=1,\ldots,m$), which obviously has the solution $\lambda = \sqrt[m]{\prod_{i=1}^m{\lambda_i}}$ 
and $\mu_{\tau^k(1)}=\frac{1}{\lambda^k}\prod_{i=0}^k{\lambda_{\tau^i(1)}}\mu_1$ (all solutions $(\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_m)$ are a multiple of each other). 
Thus $\rho$ in this special case has a unique fixed point in the interior of $\tilde{B}$ (and thus $B$).

\begin{remark}\label{rem7}
In this case the operator $T^m$ coincides with the homothety $v\mapsto \lambda^m v$. From this it follows that any eigenvalue must be of the form $\lambda\zeta$ where $\zeta$ is an $m$-th root of unity.
If $m=n$ we may explicitly calculate the eigenvalues of $T$ by taking $\partial_0{\tilde{B}}$ as the representation base:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{M}_{\partial_0{\tilde{B}}}^{\partial_0{\tilde{B}}}(T)=\begin{pmatrix}
0 & \lambda_1 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
\vdots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \cdots\\
\vdots &  & \ddots & \ddots & 0\\
0 & \cdots & \cdots & 0 & \lambda_{n-1}\\
\lambda_n & 0 & \cdots & \cdots & 0
\end{pmatrix}\text{.}
\end{equation}
This yields $\chi_T(\mu)=(-1)^n(\mu^n-\lambda^n)$ from which one deduces that the eigenvalues of $T$ are exactly those of the form $\lambda\zeta$ where $\zeta$ is any $n$-th root of unity.
\end{remark}

\paragraph{The general case.}

Let us now reconsider the case where $\tau=c_1\compose\cdots\compose c_l$. Then for each $c_i$ we may apply the observations from the last paragraph in the corresponding subspace. We thus may deduce that there exists a unique eigenvector $v$ in $V^+$ (up to positive multiples) if and only if $\tau$ is a single cycle.

%\subsection{A fact about $\tilde{B}$}
%
%For the proof of theorem (\ref{theo1}) we will need the following
%
%\begin{lemma}\label{lem4} Let $\tilde{B}$ not be a singleton and $v\in\partial_0{\tilde{B}}$ be a vertex such that $v$ is an eigenvector of $T^{\ord\tau}$ of the smallest (positive) eigenvalue $\lambda_{\min}$. Then $v$ is a vertex of $B$. 
%
%\end{lemma}
%
%\begin{proof}
%The proof is elementary computation. Let (as previously) $v_1,\ldots,v_m$ be the vertices of $\tilde{B}$ and $\tilde{\lambda}_1,\ldots,\tilde{\lambda}_m$ ($0<\tilde{\lambda}_i\leq\tilde{\lambda}_j$ for $i<j$) be the corresponding eigenvalues with respect to $T^{\ord\tau}$. Furthermore, w.l.o.g. let $v=v_1$. 
%
%Assume $v$ is not a vertex of $B$. Then there are some $\alpha_k\in\reals$ ($k=2,\ldots,m$) such that $v_1+\sum_{k=2}^m{\alpha_k v_k},v_1-\sum_{k=2}^m{\alpha_k v_k}\in B$ (that is $v=v_1$ lies in the interior of some nontrivial convex hull of two points which lies in $B$). Now we have two cases
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item If $\tilde{\lambda}_i=\tilde{\lambda}_j$ (for all $i,j=1,\ldots,m$) then the above vectors are themselves eigenvectors of $T^{\ord\tau}$ and thus lie in $\tilde{B}$ which leads to the contradiction that $v$ is not a vertex of $\tilde{B}$.
%\item If $\tilde{\lambda}_m=\cdots=\tilde{\lambda}_{j+1}>\tilde{\lambda}_j$ (for some $j\geq 1$) then applying $T$ repeatedly to the above two vectors leads to the fact that $\sum_{i=j+1}^m{\alpha_iv_i},-\sum_{i=j+1}^m{\alpha_iv_i}\in B$ which contradicts the condition that $B$ is a cone (this argument is due to the compactness of $B$ and due to the fact that the largest eigenvalue in modulus dominates the behavior of $T^l(v_1+\sum_{k=2}^m{\alpha_k v_k})$ and $T^l(v_1-\sum_{k=2}^m{\alpha_k v_k})$ ($l\rightarrow\infty$), respectively).
%\end{enumerate}
%
%Thus $v$ must be a vertex of $B$.
%\end{proof}

\section{Some final lemmas}

We need to recall the following elementary from linear algebra

\begin{lemma}[characterization of uniform boundedness of an operator]\label{lem4}
Let $A:V\to V$ some linear operator where $\dim{V}=n<\infty$. Then the powers $A^m$ ($m\in\nats$) are uniformly bounded if and only if all complex eigenvalues $\mu$ of $A$ satisfy $\module{\mu}\leq 1$ and if $\module{\mu}=1$ then the algebraic multiplicity and the geometric multiplicity coincide.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By an appropriate choice of the (complex) base we may assume $A$ can be represented as some Jordan matrix

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{M}_B^B(A)=\diag(J_1,\ldots,J_l)
\end{equation}

such that $J_i$ ($i=1,\ldots,l$) are Jordan blocks. We than have

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{M}_B^B(A^k)=\diag(J^k_1,\ldots,J^k_l)
\end{equation}

for $k\in\nats$ from which we see that no complex eigenvalue can have larger modulus than one (otherwise $A^m$ would not be bounded) Moreover if some eigenvalue $\mu$ with $\module{\mu}=1$ has a non-trivial Jordan block $J$ then by

\begin{equation}
J^k=(\mu I + N)^k =\sum_{i=0}^k{{k \choose i}\mu^i N^{k-i}}
\end{equation}

we see that $A^m$ would also not be uniformly bounded (here $I$ denotes the identity matrix and $N$ is the nilpotent matrix with ones on the secondary diagonal). Thus we are done (the other direction is trivial).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[internal eigenvector]\label{lem5}
Suppose $T$ has an internal point $v$ of $V^+$ as an eigenvector. Then the corresponding eigenvalue $\lambda>0$ is the largest eigenvalue of $T$ in modulus among all complex eigenvalues of $T$. Moreover, if $\lambda'$ is a complex eigenvalue of $T$ such that $\module{\lambda'}=\module{\lambda}$ then the algebraic and geometric multiplicity of $\lambda'$ coincide.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Consider the strictly positive operator $S:=T/\lambda$. We prove that the powers of $S$ are uniformly bounded and apply the previous lemma.
Let $u=u_1-u_2\in V$ where $u_1,u_2\in V^+$ (this is possible because $V^+$ is generating). From this representation it is clear that it suffices to prove that the powers of $S$ are uniformly bounded on $V^+$. But this follows from the fact that $S[0,v]\subset [0,S(v)]=[0,v]$ (as $S$ is positive operator) because $[0,v]$ is also generating (in the sense that for any $u\in V$ there are $u_1,u_2\in[0,v],\mu_1,\mu_2\geq 0$ such that $v=\mu_1u_1-\mu_2u_2$) as $v$ is an internal point of $V$ (and thus an order unit). 
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[symmetry property of the spectrum $\sigma(T)$]\label{lem6}
Let $V$ have polytopic cone. Suppose $T$ has an internal point $v$ of $V^+$ as eigenvector (corresponding eigenvalue $\lambda$). Then any other eigenvalue $\lambda'$ of maximal modulus (i.e. by previous lemma $\module{\lambda'}=\module{\lambda}$) is of the form $\lambda\zeta$ where $\zeta$ is a root of unity of order smaller that the number $q$ of vertices of the cone.  
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We already proved a stronger fact for simplicial (lattice cones) which is stated in remark (\ref{rem7}). 

By the previous lemma we know that all Jordan chains of such $\lambda'$ behave trivial. W.l.o.g. we may assume that $\lambda=1$ (otherwise let us define $S:=T/\lambda$ as previously and do the argument on $S$). Then, for some $\epsilon>0$ we obviously find a number $m\in\nats$ such that $\module{\lambda'^m-1}<\epsilon$ holds for all $\lambda'$ of modulus one. From this we see that there is some $m\in\nats$ such that the pair of vectors $(v_1,v_2)=(\Re{\tilde{v}},\Im{\tilde{v}})$ (where $\tilde{v},\overline{\tilde{v}}$ are the associated complex eigenvectors of $\lambda',\overline{\lambda'}$) is nearly left invariant under $S^m$, i.e. for some $\epsilon>0$ there is $m\in\nats$ such that $\norm{v_i-S^m(v_i)}<\epsilon$ ($i=1,2$). 

Let $U:=\lin(\{v_1,v_2:v_1,v_2\text{ associated to some } \lambda' \text{ with } |\lambda'|=1\}\unify \Eig_\lambda(T))$. We then have $\tilde{B}\supset U\intersect B$ from the last property. But from this (and from the fact that $v$ is an internal point of $V^+$) we get that $S^{\ord\tau}$ acts as the identity on $U$ and thus all $\lambda'$ must be roots of unity of order smaller than the number of vertices $q$ of $V^+$ (from remark (\ref{rem7})).
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
This does not hold for non polytopic cones. To see this consider the ordered vector space $\reals^3$ with the cone $K:=\{x\in\reals^3:x_1\geq \sqrt{x_2^2+x_3^2}\}$ and the operator given by the matrix
\begin{equation}
M:=\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & a & b \\
0 & -b & a 
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
where $a+b\i=e^{2\pi\i r}$ for some $r\in\reals\setminus\rats$.
\end{remark}

\section{The proof}

We have collected all facts for the proof of the two theorems. Let us reassemble them.

The first thing which is of importance is that in both cases there cannot be an eigenvector on the boundary of the cone (simply because by the properties of $T$ in the theorems). Thus we know by lemma (\ref{lem1}) that there exists a positive eigenvector in the interior of $V^+$ (for non-polytopic cone in theorem (\ref{theo1}) one would need some approximation argument which shall not be done here - Brouwer would also do it). 

\paragraph{Algebraic multiplicity one.} Now, let us prove that the algebraic multiplicity of the corresponding eigenvalue $\lambda$ is one. Suppose it would be larger than one. Then by lemma (\ref{lem5}) we woulds have $\dim\Eig_\lambda(T)>1$. But then $\Eig_\lambda(T)$ has non-empty intersection with the boundary of $B$. To see this take another eigenvector $v'\in\Eig_\lambda(T)$ which is linearly independent from $v$ the line $v+\reals v'$ must intersect with the boundary of $V^+$ otherwise $V$ would not be Archimedean and would thus not admit a base).

\paragraph{Strict maximum.} Let us prove that $\lambda$ is the strict maximum in modulus in $\sigma(T)$ (theorem (\ref{theo1}). Otherwise, from lemma (\ref{lem6}) we know that there is a power of $T^m$ which has no other eigenvalues of modulus $\lambda^m$ (e.g. take $T^{q!}$). But this power is also primitive. Thus $\lambda^m$ must have algebraic multiplicity one. From this it follows that the number of eigenvalues of modulus $\lambda$ of $T$ is also one.

\paragraph{Symmetry properties of $\sigma(T)$.} We are left with the 3. point of theorem (\ref{theo2}). But this was already proven by lemma (\ref{lem6}) and remark (\ref{rem7}).

\section{Example: The spectral radius of the infinite $d$-regular tree}

The theorem of Perron-Frobenius has many applications. One which is of significant importance is its usage in graph theory.

As primitive matrices can be interpreted as weighted adjacency matrices of \emph{strongly connected graphs} $G$ having the property that $\gcd\{|C|:C \text{ is circle in } G\}=1$ and positive irreducible matrices can be seen as weighted adjacency matrices of \emph{strongly connected graphs} (the graph $G$ is called strongly connected if any two vertices are joined by a path.

\paragraph{The example.} It is a well known theorem due to Nilli that any $d$-regular connected graph $G$ of diameter $m$ has its biggest non-trivial eigenvalue greater than $2\sqrt{d-1}(1-1/m)$. We want to prove another well known fancy result.

\begin{lemma}
Let $G=(V,E)$ be a connected tree with $\max_{v\in V} d(v)\leq d$. Then the adjacency for the adjacency matrix $M$ of $G$ we have $\varrho(M)\leq 2\sqrt{d-1}$. 
\end{lemma}

The proof of this result can be done elementary (or using extremal graph theory). 
We will five an elementary proof.

\begin{proof}
Let us extend $G$ to the infinite $d$-regular tree $G'$. Then the adjacency matrix $M'$ of $G'$ can be interpreted as an operator on $\boldsymbol{l}^2$. As the operators $M$ and $M'$ are self-adjoint it holds that $\norm{M}_2=\varrho(M)$ and $\norm{M'}_2=\varrho{M'}$. 

Moreover, as $M$ is an initial square submatrix of $M'$ we have $\varrho(M)=\norm{M}_2\leq\norm{M'}_2=\varrho(M')$. Hence, we just need to show that $\rho(M')=2\sqrt{d-1}$. From Perron-Frobenius theorem for irreducible matrices we know that $\rho(M)$ is attained as an eigenvalue $\lambda>0$ whose eigenvector is strictly positive (as $M$ is irreducible) 

To see this, consider the powers of $M$ and its behavior on the main diagonal.
Basically, $(M^m)_{ii}$ counts the paths of length $m$ starting and ending at vertex $i$. Let us denote this number by $\beta_m$.

We will calculate $\beta_i$ with some help of combinatorics.
A path from vertex $i$ to $i$ can be parameterized by two sequences $(a_j)_{j=1}^l$ and $(b_j)_{j=1}^l$ satisfying $\sum_{j=1}^m{a_j}\geq\sum_{j=1}^m{b_j}$ for $m<l$ and $\sum_{j=1}^l{a_j}\geq\sum_{j=1}^l{b_j}$.

At first we walk from $i$ along some path of length $a_1$. Then we backtrack this path by $b_1$ steps. Again we start a new path of length $a_2$ (which does not backtrack) etc.

During each step in the sequence $(a_j)$ we may choose from $d-1$ possible directions (disregarding the beginning where we may choose from $d$ directions).

It is clear that for $m$ odd the number of circles starting and ending at $i$ is zero. So let $m=2k$ ($k\in\nats$).

We already constructed a (not very formal) bijection between the set of such sequences $(a_j)$ and $(b_j)$ times some set of the size $d(d-1)^{k-1}$ to the number of such paths $\beta_{2k}$. Let us denote the former number by $C_k$. It is easy to see that this number satisfies the recurrence relation (as it is the number of one dimensional random walks from $0$ to $2k$)
\begin{equation}
C_{k+1}=\sum_{i=0}^k{C_iC_{k-i}}\text{.}
\end{equation}
This shows us that $C_k$ are actually the Catalan numbers, thus $C_n=\frac{1}{k+1}{2k \choose k}$.
From this we get

\begin{equation}
\beta_{2k}=d(d-1)^{k-1}\frac{1}{k+1}{2k \choose k}
\end{equation}
Let us now consider any initial square submatrix $\tilde{M}\in\reals^{n\times n}$ of $M'$. We then have $\lim_{n\to\infty}\varrho(\tilde{M})=\varrho(M')$ (which is true as we are in a separable Hilbert space). Moreover, the diagonal entries of $\tilde{M}^{2k}$ can at most be $\beta_{2k}$. Thus we get

\begin{equation}
\varrho(\tilde{M}) =\limsup_{k\to\infty} \sqrt[2k]{\trace{\tilde{M}^{2k}}}\leq \limsup_{k\to\infty}{\sqrt[2k]{\beta_{2k}}}=2\sqrt{d-1}
\end{equation}
Where the last can be checked using Stirlings formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Connection between finite-dimensional operators and weighted adjacency matrices of graphs}

\begin{definition}[weighted adjacency matrix, induced graph]
Let $G=(V,E)$ a directed (or undirected) graph. Then a weight on the edges of $G$ is some map $\omega:E\to \reals^+$. The weighted adjacency matrix of $G$ is then a non-negative matrix $\reals^{n\times n}$ ($n=\module{V}$) which has as entries the values of $\omega$ and zeros where no edges exist (via some numbering of the vertices).
On the other hand, given any non-negative $A$ one defines the induced weighted graph (up to isomorphism) as the pair $(G,\omega)$ such that $A$ is a weighted adjacency matrix.
\end{definition}

We then have the following connections

\begin{itemize}
\item A non-negative matrix $A$ is periodic with period $p$ (that is $p=\gcd\{n\in\nats:\exists i\in[n](A^n)_ii\}$) if and only if for the induced graph $G$ we have $p=\gcd\{|C|:C \text{ cycle in } G\}$.
\item A non-negative matrix $A$ is irreducible (that is there is no permutation matrix $P$ and non-vanishing square matrices $A,B$ such that $P^{-1}AP=\begin{pmatrix} A & C \\ 0 & B\end{pmatrix}$\footnote{irreducible is defined for general matrices}) if and only if the induced graph $G$ is strongly connected (that is any two vertices are joined by a path - or topologically: the graph as topological (even metric space) has only one path component).
\item A non-negative matrix $A$ is primitive if and only if $A$ is aperiodic (that is $p=1$) and irreducible (the induced graph is aperiodic and strongly connected).
\item A graph $G$ is periodic with period $p$ if and only if there $p$ is the maximal natural number such that there exists some partition $\{V_1,\ldots,V_p\}=:\mathcal{P}$ of its vertices such  that any edge starting in $V_i$ ends in $V_{i+1}$ (mod $p$)\footnote{such partition is unique up to cyclic permutation}.
\end{itemize}

We will give a simple proof of the following lemma 

\begin{lemma}
Let $A$ be a periodic matrix with the representation 
\begin{equation}
A = 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & A_1 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
\vdots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \cdots\\
\vdots &  & \ddots & \ddots & 0\\
0 & \cdots & \cdots & 0 & A_{n-1}\\
A_n & 0 & \cdots & \cdots & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
where $A_i\in\complex^{n_i\times n_{i+1}}$ (where $n_i$ can be interpreted as the cardinalities of $V_i$ where $\{V_i:i=1,\ldots,p\}$ is the maximal periodic partition). Then the pairs of eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors $(\lambda,v)$ are invariant under the following actions (let $v^{\trans}=(v_1,\ldots,v_p)$ with $v_i\in\complex^{n_i}$):
\begin{equation}
\phi_{\zeta}(\lambda,v)=\left(\zeta\lambda,\begin{pmatrix}
v_1 \\ \zeta v_2 \\ \cdots \\ \zeta^{p-1} v_p
\end{pmatrix}
\right)\text{.}
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{remark}
Thus the group $\ints_p$ acts on $\sigma(a)$ with $\stab_{\ints_p}(v)=\{0\}$ (or thinking in the group $\generate{\zeta}$ we would write $\{1\}$). From this it is immediately clear by orbit-stabilizer theorem that for each eigenvalue $\lambda\in\sigma(A)$ there are exactly $p$ eigenvalues  of the modulus $\module{\lambda}$ (namely $\orb_{\ints_p}(\lambda)$). Moreover, the algebraic multiplicity (more explicitly the structure of the corresponding Jordan-submatrices) are the same.
\end{remark}

\begin{proof}
Some easy calculation.
\end{proof}
