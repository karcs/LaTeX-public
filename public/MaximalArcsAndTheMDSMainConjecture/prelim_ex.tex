\begin{exercise}
    Let $P$ and $Q$ be projective spaces of dimension $n$ and $m$ with $P\leq Q$. Prove that the number of $k$-dimensional subspaces $R$ such that $R\leq R\leq Q$ is $\binom[q]{n-m+1}{k-m+1}$ (Hint: consider the quotient geometry $Q/P$).
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
    Let $P$ and $Q$ be projective of dimensions $n$ and $m$ with $P\leq Q$. Prove that the number of complements of $Q$ is equal to $q^{(n-m)(m+1)}$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
    Prove that $\PGL(n,K)$ acts sharply transitive on the set of $(n+1)$-tuples of points of $\PG(n-1,K)$ in general position.
