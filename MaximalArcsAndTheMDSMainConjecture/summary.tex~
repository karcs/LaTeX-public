\section*{Conclusion}

Summing up, we have given an introduction to the MDS main conjecture and related topics in this thesis.
It is self-evident, that there are many things which were left untouched and many questions for which cannot give a satisfactory answer (e.g.~the completeness of normal rational curves in finite vector spaces).
