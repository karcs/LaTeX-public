\section*{Conclusion}

Summing up, we have given an introduction to the MDS main conjecture and related topics in this thesis.
It is self-evident, that there are many things which were left untouched and many questions for which cannot give a satisfactory answer (e.g.~the completeness of normal rational curves in finite vector spaces, another gap which could not be closed is weather there is a classification of $(q+1)$-arcs when $n\leq 2p-2$).
The initial intention --- to present the proofs of \person{Ball} and \person{de Beule} in an appropriate form for an undergraduate stutent --- should basically be acheaved.
