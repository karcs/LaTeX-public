\section{Generic hyperplane arrangements}

\subsection{Existence of weakly generic arrangements in $\field{q}^n$ with given Poincaré polynomial}

Let $\cA$ be an arrangement of hyperplanes in $V=K^n$ and $\cL(\cA):=\{\bigsetmeet \cH:\cH\setleq \cA\}$ the associated lattice, where for $X,Y\in\cL(\cA)$ we define $X\meet Y:=\bigsetmeet\{Z\in\cL(\cA):X,Y\setleq Z\}$ and $X\join Y:= X\setmeet Y$.
Moreover, we assign to $\cL(\cA)$ the rank function $r:\cL(\cA)\to \ints$ where $X\mapsto \codim X$ for $X\neq \emptyset$ and $r(\emptyset):=-1$.
It is then an interesting question, which restrictions on the lattice $\cL(\cA)$ arise from the structure of the space $K^n$ (especially when $K$ is finite). We want to discuss this question for a special type of arrangements.

We need the following definitions.

\begin{definition}[unique representation of lattice elements] 
    Let $L$ be a lattice with $0$ (minimal element). Then $X\in L$ is called uniquely representable if it can uniquely be written as the join of atoms.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    If $X\in\cL(\cA)$ is uniquely representable and $Y\leq X$ then is also uniquely representable. 
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[weakly generic arrangement]
    Let $\cA$ be an arrangement such that any element $X\in\cL(\cA)\setminus\set{\emptyset}$ is uniquely representable. Then $\cA$ is called \keyword{weakly generic}.
\end{definition}

A fact, which is also obvious is that a lattice $\cL$ is the lattice $\cL(\cA)$ for an arrangement $\cA$ in $K^n$ if and only it is embedded in $\Sub_{\aff}(V)$ (by a rank preserving map). However, it turns out to be very difficult to decide this for a given lattice.
We now drop some information and breafly discuss the above question for a weakly generic arrangement $\cA$ in $K^n$ with given \person{Poincaré} polynomial.

\subsection{Some combinatorial facts about weakly generic arrangements}

In this section we generalize some combinatorial results by \person{Zaslavsky} about the number of components of the complement $\cM(\cA)=:\cM_0(\cA)$ and its analogue in the discrete case.

\begin{lemma}[point numbers of the strata $\cM_m$ of arrangements in finite vector spaces]
    Let $\cA$ be a weakly generic arrangement in $\field{q}^n$. Then it holds that
    $$
        \abs{\cM_m(\cA)}= q^{n-m}\frac{\pi^{(m)}(\cA,-q^{-1})}{m!}
    $$
    where $\cM(\cA)$ denotes the $m$-th stratum ($m\geq 0$)
    $$        \cM(\cA):=\bigsetjoin\{X\in\cL(\cA)\lgand r(X)=m\}\setminus\bigsetjoin\{X\in\cL(\cA):r(X)=m+1\}\text{.}
    $$
    For $m=0$ the arrangement does not have to be weakly generic (\person{Zaslavsky}'s result \cite{zas}).
\end{lemma}

The proof of this fact is just based on \person{Möbius} inversion

\begin{proof}
    We start with $m=0$.
    As $\bigsetjoin_{X\in\cL(\cA)}{\cM_0(\cA^X)}=\field{q}^n$ (where $\cA^X$ denotes the restriction of $\cA$ on $X$) and the union is disjoint we have that (for $Y\in\cL(\cA)$)
  $$
      \sum_{\substack{X\in\cL(\cA)\\ X\geq Y}}{\abs{\cM_0(\cA^X)}}=q^{n-r(Y)}\text{.}
  $$
  Möbius inversion reveals
  $$
      \sum_{X\in\cL(\cA)}{\mu(V,Y)q^{n-r(Y)}} = q^n\pi(\cA,-q^{-1}) = \abs{\cM_0(\cA)}\text{.}
  $$
  This is essentially a result analogue to the lemma proved by \person{Zaslavsky} in~\cite{zas}. Note that we did not use that $\cA$ is weakly generic.
  For the case $m>0$ we obtain
  $$
      \abs{\cM_m(\cA)}=\sum_{\substack{X\in\cL(\cA)\\ r(X)=m}}{\abs{\cM_0(\cA^X)}}=\sum_{\substack{X\in\cL(\cA)\\ r(X)=m}}{\sum_{Y\in\cL(\cA^X)}{\mu_{\cA^X}(X,Y)q^{n-r(Y)}}}\text{.}
  $$
  Now, we use the fact (which can be easily shown by induction) that for a weakly generic arrangement $\cA$ we have $\mu(X,Y)={(-1)}^{r(X)-r(Y)}$ and as restrictions of weakly generic arrangements are again weakly generic, we obtain from the above (interchanging the sums and counting the elements $X$ above $Y$).
  $$\eqalign{
      \abs{\cM_m(\cA)}
      & = q^n\sum_{Y\in\cL(\cA)}{{(-1)}^{m-r(Y)}\binom{r(Y)}{m}q^{-r(Y)}}\cr
      & = q^n\frac{\pi^{(m)}(\cA,-q^{-1})}{m!}
  }
  $$
  which finishes the proof.
\end{proof}

For the sake of completeness, we shall give the real analogue of that last fact

\begin{lemma}[number of connected components of the stratum $\cM_m(\cA)$ of an arrangement] Let $\cA$ be a weakly generic arrangement in the vector space $V$ over $\reals$. Then it holds that
    $$
        \frac{\pi^{(m)}(\cA,1)}{m!}=\abs{\comp(\cM_m(\cA))}\text{.}
    $$
    For $m=0$ the arrangement does not have to be weakly generic (\person{Zaslavsky}'s result ...).
\end{lemma}

Here, the proof is analogous.

\begin{proof}
    Starting with $m=0$, we can apply \person{Euler}'s formula gives (for $Y\in\cL(\cA)$)
    $$
        \sum_{\substack{X\in\cL(\cA)\\ X\geq Y}}{(-1)^{r(Y)-r(X)}\abs{\comp(\cM_0(\cA^X))}}=1=\chi(\reals^{n-r(Y)})\text{.}
  $$
  Möbius inversion delivers
  $$
    \sum_{X\in\cL(\cA)}{\mu(V,X)(-1)^{r(Y)}} = \pi(\cA,1) = \abs{\comp(\cM_0(\cA))}\text{.}
  $$
  For $m>0$, the proof is identical with the last one
  $$\eqalign{
      \abs{\comp(\cM_m(\cA))} &=\sum_{\substack{X\in\cL(\cA)\\ r(X)=m}}{\abs{\comp(\cM_0(\cA^X))}}\cr
      & = \sum_{\substack{X\in\cL(\cA)\cr r(X)=m}}{\sum_{Y\in\cL(\cA^X)}{\mu_{\cA^X}(X,Y){(-1)}^{r(X)-r(Y)}}}.
  }
  $$
  Now, use that $\mu(X,Y)={(-1)}^{r(X)-r(Y)}$ if $\cA$ is weakly generic and as restrictions of weakly generic arrangements are again weakly generic, we obtain from the above
  $$
  \eqalign{
      \abs{\comp(\cM_m(\cA))}
      & =\sum_{Y\in\cL(\cA)}{\binom{r(Y)}{m}}\cr
      & = \frac{\pi^{(m)}(\cA,1)}{m!}
      }
  $$
  finishing the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
    An alternative proof of the last two lemmas can be given via deletion restriction theorem and the identity $\pi(\cA,t)=\pi(\cA',t)+t\pi(\cA'',t)$. The $m$-th derivative of this last identity behaves analogue to some recurrence relations of the above numbers for $(\cA,\cA',\cA'')$ a generic triple of arrangements.
\end{remark}

\begin{corollary}
    Let $\cA$ be a weakly generic arrangement in $\field{q}^n$. Then it holds that $\pi(\cA,t)=\pi_q(\cA,t+q^{-1})$ for a polynomial $\pi_q(\cA,t)$ with positive coefficients.
\end{corollary}

This corollary gives a partial answer to our question, but its statement only uses the lattice structure and is careless about the nature of the sets of that lattice (as linear subspaces). It turns out that this answer is not very sharp in some cases.

\subsection{Translational pertubations of arrangements}

Next, we study what happens if one modifies the hyperplanes $H$ of an arrangement $\cA$ by translations $\{\theta_H\}_{H\in\cA}$ such that the new arrangement is closer to a weakly generic one.

At first we need some definitions

\begin{definition}[translational pertubation of an arrangement]
    Let $\cA$ and $\cB$ be arrangements. We say that $\cB$ is
    \emph{translational pertubation} of $\cA$ via the family of translations $\{\theta_H\}_{H\in\cA}$ if $H^{\phi_H}$ are the (distinct) hyperplanes of $\cB$ ($H\in\cA$).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[pure pertubation]
    Let $\cB$ be a translational pertubation of the arrangement $\cA$ via the tranlations $\{\theta_H\}_{H\in\cA}$. We say that $\cB$ is a \emph{pure pertubation} of $\cA$ via $\{\theta_H\}_{H\in\cA}$ if it holds that if 
    $$
    X = \bigjoin\{H_i^{\theta_{H_i}}:i=1,\ldots,l\} = \bigjoin\{J_i^{\theta_{J_i}}:i=1,\ldots,m\}\in\cL(\cB)
  $$ has two representations in atoms then 
  $$
      \bigjoin\{H_i:i=1,\ldots,l\}=\bigjoin\{J_i:i=1,\ldots,m\}\in\cL(\cA)\text{.}
  $$
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    If $\cB$ is a pure translational perturbation of $\cA$ via $\{\theta_H\}_{H\in\cA}$ then there is a unique epimorphism $\phi:\cL(\cB)\to\cL(\cA)$ which satisfies $H^{\theta_H}\mapsto H$. First, note that the uniqueness follows from the fact that $\phi$ is defined on atoms of $\cB$. To see that $\phi$ exists,
    pick $X\in\cL(\cA)$ such that $X=\bigjoin\{H_i^{\theta_{H_i}}:i=1,\ldots,l\}$. Then it must hold that $\phi(X)=\bigjoin\{H_i:i=1,\ldots,l\}$. The above definition ensures that this last equation is also a definition (this is basically the notion of the homomorphism theorem).
    We call $\phi:\cB\to\cA$ the natural map with respect to the pertubation via $\{\theta_H\}_{H\in\cA}$. 
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[universal translational perturbation]
    etc.
\end{definition}

The following lemma shows that the question of the existence of a universal translational pertubation in infinite vector spaces has a simple answer.

\begin{lemma}[existence of universal translational perturbations in infinite vector spaces]
    If $\cA$ is an arrangement in some $F$-vector space $V$ such that $\card{V}=\infty$ a universal translational perturbation $\cA^{\tpert}$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    There are only finitely many points 
\end{proof}

---TO BE CONTINUED


When $\cA$ is an arrangement in a finite vector space, it is a very difficult problem to say if $\cA^{\tpert}$ exists.

\subsection{Generic and central generic arrangements}

As previously mentioned the connection between generic and central generic arrangements is that any central generic arrangement is the cone of a generic one and conversely any generic arrangement can be obtained deconing a central generic arrangement (which is somehow an analogue of the relation between affine and projective space).

Now let $\cA$ be a generic arrangement of $n$ hyperplanes in the $l$-dimensional vector space $V$ and let $\cone{\cA}$ the corresponding central generic arrangement.

For our purposes the \person{Poincaré} polynomials of these arrangements are of special interest.
In the case of the generic arrangement $\cA$ one has $\mu(X)=(-1)^{r(X)}$ for $X\in L(\cA)$ and the sets $\{X\in L(\cA):r(X)=k\}$ have the cardinality $\binom{n}{k}$. Thus one obtains
$$
  \pi(\cA,t)=\sum_{k=0}^n{\binom{n}{k}t^k}\text{.}
$$

By the above and a well-known fact it follows for the corresponding central generic arrangement that
$$
  \pi(\cone{\cA},t)=(1+t)\pi(\cA,t)=(1+t)\sum_{k=0}^n{\binom{n}{k}t^k}\text{.}
$$

% some stuff that did not make that much sense

% \begin{definition}[degradation] Let $\cA}$ be an arrangement and $X\in L(\cA})$. %Then define the \emph{degradation} of $X$ as $d(X):=\abs{\{H\in\cA}:X\geq H\}}-r(X)$. %Moreover, for $c\in \cC}_m(\cA})$ define $d(c):=d(\aff(c))$.
% \end{definition}

% \begin{remark} 
%   The degradation 'measures' the difference of the number of hyperplanes containing $X$ in %$\cA}$ and the essential number of hyperplanes to generate $X$. Of course $X$ is uniquely %representable if and only if $d(X)=0$
% \end{remark}

\subsection{Usage of the generalizing statement for the discrete case}

We will now apply these nice results to the problem of the existence of generic arrangements.

To check whether certain triples $(q,l,n)$ can be excluded we want to check whether the values of the expressions for the number of points in $C_m(\cA)$ make sense.

The \person{Poincaré} polynomial of a generic arrangement in $GF(q)^l$ of $n$ hyperplanes is given by

$$
  \pi(\cA,t)=\sum_{i=0}^l{\binom{n}{i}t^i}\text{.}
$$

As this type of polynomials will be the subject of consideration for the next lines we define

$$
  P_i^j(t):=\sum_{k=0}^i{\binom{j}{k}t^k}\text{.}
$$

If $\cA$ is a generic arrangement corresponding to the triple $(q,l,n)$ (where $l<n$, otherwise it is boring) then any subarrangement consisting of $\tilde{n}$ hyperplanes is also generic (and of the type $(q,l,\tilde{n})$ where $\tilde{n}\leq n$). Let $\tilde{\cA}$ be any such subarrangement of $\cA$ with $r(\tilde{\cA})=\tilde{n}$ (number of hyperplanes as $\tilde{A}$ is generic). Then the identities

$$
  0 \leq \abs{C_m(\tilde{\cA})} \leq q^l \text{ for } 0\leq m\leq\tilde{n}\text{.}
$$

must hold for $\tilde{n}=0,\ldots,n$. Translating this to the \person{Poincaré} polynomials one gets the necessary conditions

\begin{align}
  0\leq q^{l-m}\frac{\pi^{(m)}(\tilde{\cA},-q^{-1})}{m!} \leq q^l \text{ for } 0\leq m\leq\min\{l,\tilde{n}\}
\end{align}

where $\tilde{n}=0,\ldots,n$. It is now obvious that the first inequality implies the second ($\leq q^l$) as

$$
  \sum_{m=0}^{\tilde{n}}{q^{l-m}\frac{\pi^{(m)}(\tilde{\cA},-q^{-1})}{m!}}=\pi(\tilde{\cA},0)q^l=q^l
$$

and thus if all summands are greater or equal to zero, each of them must satisfy the second inequality. Another important fact is that

$$
  \pi^{(m)}(\tilde{\cA},-q^{-1})=\tilde{n}\cdots(\tilde{n}-m+1)P_{l-m}^{\tilde{n}-m}(t)
$$
for $m=0,\ldots,\min\{\tilde{n},l\}$. Moreover, one can omit the cases where $\tilde{n}\leq n$ because then $P_{l-m}^{\tilde{n}-m}(-q^{-1})=(1-q^{-1})^{\tilde{n}-m}>0$ for $m=0\ldots,\tilde{n}$.

Thus rewrite the condition for $q$ as

$$
  P_i^j(q^{-1})\geq 0 \text{ for } j=l+1,\ldots,n \text{ and } j-i\leq n-l\text{.}
$$

We will see that these inequalities are equivalent with $q\geq l-n+1$.

At first an easy fact about $P_i^j$

\begin{lemma}
  Let $j>i\geq 0$ ($j>1$) then $P_i^j$ is monotone on $[0,1]$ and has a single zero in $(0,1)$ if $i$ is odd.
  If $i$ is even, $P_i^j$ is strictly positive on $[0,1]$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  The proof is simple and happens by induction on $i$. For $i=0$ the statement is obvious as $P_0^j(t)=1>0$.

  Assume the statement holds for all $i<k$. 
  \paragraph{Case where $k$ is odd:}
  Then for $P_k^j$ we have $P_k^j(0)=1$ and
  $$
    P_k^j(1)=\sum_{\nu=0}^{\frac{k-1}{2}}{\left(\binom{j}{2\nu}-\binom{j}{2\nu+1}\right)}
  $$
  Now, if $k\leq \ceil{j/2}$ all summands are non-positive and the first is negative as $j>1$. In the opposite case, we use that $P_k^j(1)=-(-1)^jP_{j-k-1}^j(1)$. By induction hypothesis we have that $\sgn(P_{j-k}^j(1))=(-1)^{j-k-1}$. Thus obtain $P_k^j(1)=-(-1)^j(-1)^{j-k-1}=(-1)^k$ as desired. Moreover, by induction hypothesis $P_k^j$ is strictly decreasing as $\frac{d}{d t}P_k^j(t)=-jP_{k-1}^{j-1}(t)<0$. Thus $P_k^j$ has a single zero in $(0,1)$.
  
  \paragraph{Case where $k$ is even:} In this case we have that $P_k^j(0)=1>0$ and $P_k^j(1)>0$ (by similar argument as in the previous case). Assume $P_k^j$ attains its minimum in $\xi\in(0,1)$ (otherwise we are done as it is positive on $0$ and $1$. Then its derivative $\frac{d}{d t}P_k^j(\xi)=-jP_{k-1}^{j-1}(\xi)=0$. It is obvious that

  $$
    P_k^j(t)=\sum_{\nu=0}^k{\binom{j}{\nu}(-t)^\nu}=\sum_{\nu=0}^{k-1}{\binom{j-1}{\nu}(-t)^\nu}-t\sum_{\nu=0}^{k-1}{\binom{j-1}{\nu}(-t)^\nu}+\binom{n-1}{k-1}(-t)^k
  $$

  from which we deduce that $P_k^j(\xi)=\binom{n-1}{k-1}(-\xi)^k>0$. Thus we are done with the proof.
\end{proof}

Using this lemma, it is now clear that we are searching for the smallest zero $\xi$ of the polynomials $P_i^j$ for $j=l+1,\ldots,n$ and $j-i\leq n-l$ in $[0,1]$ where we can drop the even $i$ as the corresponding polynomials have no zeros in this interval. 

Next, we find some monotony among these zeros.

\begin{lemma}
  Let $\xi\in(0,1)$ and $j>i\geq 0$ and $i$ be odd such that $P_i^j(\xi)=0$. Then $P_{i+2}^j(\xi)>0$ and thus the unique zero of $P_{i+2}^j$ must be greater than $\xi$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Write $P_i^j$ as
  $$
    P_i^j(t)=\sum_{\nu=0}^{\frac{i-1}{2}}{t^{2\nu}\left(\binom{j}{2\nu}-\binom{j}{2\nu+1}t\right)}\text{.}
  $$
  Note when $t\in[0,1]$ the summands $t^{2\nu}\left(\binom{j}{2\nu}-\binom{j}{2\nu+1}t\right)$ negative if and only if $t>\frac{2\nu+1}{j-2\nu}$ or equivalently $\nu<\frac{jt-1}{2(t+1)}$. Thus if $P_i^j(\xi)=0$ we must have $P_{i+2}^j(\xi)>0$ as then the index $\nu$ is already 'to big'.
  This proves (with the previous lemma) that the unique zero of $P_{i+2}^j$ is greater than $\xi$.
\end{proof}

Thus it follows that the smallest zero among the the polynomials $P_i^j$ for $j=l+1,\ldots,n$, $j-i\leq n-l$ in $[0,1]$ is $\frac{1}{n-l+1}$ (the zero of $P_1^{n-l+1}$).

Our final result is now

\begin{lemma} Let $\cA$ be a generic arrangement corresponding to the triple $(q,l,n)$. Then $q\leq n-l+1$. Similarly, if $\cA$ is a central generic arrangement and $l\geq 2$ then the same inequality holds.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  The proof was already given.
\end{proof}
